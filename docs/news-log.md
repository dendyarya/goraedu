# Daily news log

One entry per run (newest last): date, posts published (slug, kind, topic), documents skipped and why, sources that could not be reached.

## 2026-11-07 (first run, started by hand)

- Published: `does-epa-608-certification-expire-lost-card` (explainer, EPA 608);
  `how-cdl-entry-level-driver-training-is-reported-before-skills-test` (explainer, CDL). Each checked by a separate
  agent against eCFR and epa.gov text; fixes applied before publishing.
- Rule changes: none. Federal Register search (RULE and PRORULE, 2026-10-01 to 2026-11-07) for every CFR part in
  docs/daily-news.md returned no documents; eCFR showed only editorial (non-substantive) updates to 40 CFR 745.92,
  745.238 and 763 Subpart E Appendix E. EPA pages: 2027 HFC allowance notice (Oct 6, 2026) skipped (notice for
  producers/importers, no technician change).
- Unreachable: osha.gov, faa.gov, fmcsa.dot.gov, nrc.gov (not on the allowlist); eCFR covers their rules.

## 2026-11-07 (second run, scheduled)

- Published: nothing. The log already had an entry for 2026-11-07, so per docs/daily-news.md this run looked for
  rule changes only (no new explainers).
- Rule changes: none. Federal Register search (RULE and PRORULE, published 2026-11-07 or later) for every CFR part in
  docs/daily-news.md returned no documents (2026-11-07 is a Saturday; the Federal Register does not publish). The
  sanity check (40 CFR 84 from 2026-05-01) returned the two May 26, 2026 HFC documents.
- Unreachable: none needed this run (www.federalregister.gov reachable).

## 2026-11-07 (third run, scheduled, 6:40 p.m. ET)

- Published (4 explainers; day total 6): `epa-609-or-608-farm-equipment-bus-air-conditioning` (explainer, EPA 609);
  `who-certifies-drinking-water-operators-epa-or-state` (explainer, Drinking water operator);
  `does-osha-require-first-aid-kit-eyewash-station` (explainer, OSHA general industry safety);
  `osha-construction-backup-alarm-reverse-signal-rule` (explainer, OSHA construction safety). Topics chosen from
  keywords with zero explainers. Each checked by a separate agent against the fetched eCFR / epa.gov text; all
  findings fixed (citations, dropped scope conditions, one non-verbatim quote, softer EPA 609 title) before
  publishing. Deploy workflow succeeded.
- Day ends at 6 posts, under the 8 to 10 target: the second run published no explainers, and this run's cap is 4.
  Not padded.
- Rule changes: none. Federal Register search (RULE and PRORULE, published 2026-11-07 or later) for every CFR part in
  docs/daily-news.md plus 40 CFR 143 returned no documents; sanity check (40 CFR 84 from 2026-05-01) returned the two
  May 26, 2026 HFC documents.
- Considered and dropped: EPA 609 "does certification expire" (no EPA page found stating it); FAA Part 107 sub-250 g
  and accident reporting (already covered by study guides); forklift topics (all of 1910.178 covered by study guides;
  osha.gov letters not reachable); wastewater operator certification (no epa.gov page found).
- Unreachable: www.osha.gov (403 from the shell); Federal Register full-text pages
  (redirect to unblock.federalregister.gov, refused by the proxy; the API itself works); www.govinfo.gov (refused).
  The 1999 operator certification guidelines were therefore cited only through EPA's own pages.

## 2026-11-07 (extra run, requested by the owner, about 8 p.m. ET)

- The owner asked for a news search on the keyword list and for news posts. Leads came from a web search; every post
  is built only from the Federal Register document (full text via govinfo.gov) and eCFR. These rules predate the
  news section, so earlier runs ("since the last run") did not pick them up.
- Published (4 rule changes; day total 10, the daily ceiling):
  `fmcsa-final-rule-removes-cdl-self-reporting-out-of-state-convictions` (rule-change, final, CDL; FR 2026-12449);
  `fmcsa-proposes-english-proficiency-out-of-service-rule` (rule-change, proposed, CDL; FR 2026-16288);
  `faa-proposes-inspection-rating-to-replace-mechanic-inspection-authorization` (rule-change, proposed, FAA A&P
  mechanic; FR 2026-13282); `osha-reopens-comment-on-respirator-medical-evaluation-proposal` (rule-change, proposed,
  OSHA general industry safety; FR 2026-11093 and 2025-12235). Each checked by a separate agent; all findings fixed.
- Not yet covered (for later runs, within the daily ceiling): OSHA proposed rules of July 22 and 28, 2026 on
  substance-specific standards (lead, asbestos, benzene and others, 29 CFR 1910/1926); UCMR 6 proposal (July 1, 2026,
  40 CFR 141); FAA fixed-site drone restriction comment extension (June 30, 2026); NRC radiation protection proposal
  (July 15, 2026, 10 CFR 34); FMCSA non-domiciled CDL and military exception final rules (February 2026); EPA SNAP
  supplemental proposal for MVAC (April 6, 2026, 40 CFR 82).
- Leads with no official document yet: FAA Part 108 (BVLOS) final rule; OSHA heat standard; FMCSA ELDT provider
  removals (fmcsa.dot.gov refuses the shell).
- Federal Register full-text pages (federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/...) return a "Request Access" page to
  the shell; the API and govinfo.gov work.
